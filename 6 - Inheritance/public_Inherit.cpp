Derived class (Child) using **public** inheritance
The Dog class inherits from Animal publicly.
This means that all public members of Animal are accessible in Dog.
Public inheritance is the most common form of inheritance in C++.
It allows the derived class to be treated as an instance of the base class,
while still allowing access to the base class's public members.

/**************************************************
 Explanation:
- Dog publicly inherits Animal, so public members in Animal (like eat()) remain public in Dog.
- Thatâ€™s why we can call d.eat() directly in main().
